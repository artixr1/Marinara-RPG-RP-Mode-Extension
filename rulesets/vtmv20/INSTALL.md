# V:TM V20 Install Guide (RP-Mode)

Install the V:TM V20 ruleset bundle into Marinara Engine for **roleplay-mode** chats (the more open substrate — multi-agent, no engine-imposed combat/dice mechanics, lifted reputation tag cap). Namespace is `mrrp-vtmv20`.

## What this bundle ships

- **52 lorebook entries**: 13 mechanics rules + 13 V20 clans + 4 bloodlines + 9 common Disciplines + 3 clan-unique Disciplines (Necromancy, Thaumaturgy, Vicissitude) + 4 sects + Six Traditions + Humanity hierarchy + 4 Path hierarchies (Honorable Accord, Caine, Beast, Night) + sub-agent docs.
- **6 agents**: 1 main Storyteller (enabled by default, framed for RP-mode and working alongside Marinara's default world-state / prose-guardian / continuity / expression agents) + 5 optional sub-agents (state-mutator, state-reminder, combat-adjudicator, lore-query, npc-bookkeeper) — all five sub-agents installed DISABLED; toggle on via Marinara → Settings → Agents.
- **Full V20 character sheet template**: 9 Attributes (Phys/Soc/Mental), 30 Abilities (10 Talents + 10 Skills + 10 Knowledges with category in tooltip), 9+3 Disciplines as derived stats, 3 Virtues, Humanity OR Path Rating, Willpower bar, Blood Pool bar (default 10 = 13th gen), Generation, V20 7-level Health Track with Bashing/Lethal/Aggravated damage types, Soak (B/L/A), Frenzy state, Hunger Tier, Morality Track selector.

## Install (single bundle import — recommended)

1. Open Marinara → **Settings → Extensions** → confirm `RPG-Extension-RP-Mode.js` is imported and enabled (the framework loader; the same file you use for D&D 5e / Exalted 3e / Fate Core in roleplay mode).
2. In any roleplay-mode chat, open the ruleset dialog.
3. Choose **Paste bundle JSON** OR **Fetch from URL**.
4. Paste the contents of `rulesets/vtmv20/bundle.json` (or fetch from `https://github.com/Kenhito/Marinara-RPG-RP-Mode-Extension/raw/main/rulesets/vtmv20/bundle.json` once the release lands).
5. The framework auto-installs:
   - Ruleset (sheet + dice tag format + V20 difficulties)
   - Lorebook (52 entries, keyword-triggered)
   - Main Storyteller agent (enabled, fires every turn alongside default RP-mode agents)
   - 5 sub-agents (disabled; toggle individually)
6. Hard-reload Marinara (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) to clear the cached old ruleset.
7. New chat -> ruleset selector -> pick **Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary**.

## Optional: enable sub-agents

The five sub-agents are installed disabled. Each adds one model call per turn while enabled, so enable only what your chronicle needs:

| Agent | Use it when |
|---|---|
| `state-mutator` | You want narration to drive `[mrrp-state: ...]` sheet updates automatically. |
| `state-reminder` | Long sessions / complex sheets — the model is forgetting Blood Pool, Willpower, Humanity. |
| `combat-adjudicator` | You run heavy-mechanics combat encounters. Sleeps in social scenes. |
| `lore-query` | You frequently ask the model rules questions mid-RP. |
| `npc-bookkeeper` | Combat or court scenes with multiple named Kindred you want continuity on. |

**To enable**: Marinara → Settings → Agents → find `MRRP: V:TM V20 — <Role>` → toggle on.

## RP-mode-specific notes

- The 50-character reputation tag cap that GM-mode imposes is LIFTED in RP-mode. The Storyteller agent has been adjusted accordingly — Reputation event labels can be fully descriptive.
- The Storyteller agent works ALONGSIDE Marinara's default RP-mode agents (world-state, prose-guardian, continuity, expression) rather than replacing them. It only injects V20 rules guidance — let the engine's default agents handle world-state continuity, prose quality, and emotional register.
- Custom Marinara agents installed via the bundle persist in Marinara's `/api/agents` database INDEPENDENT of which extension is enabled. To remove, use Marinara → Settings → Agents → delete, OR the framework's Uninstall flow.

## Updating the ruleset later

If you edit any source file (`ruleset.json`, `lorebook.json`, `gm-agent.md`, `agents/*.md`), regenerate `agents.json` and `bundle.json`:

```sh
cd /path/to/Marinara-RPG-RP-Mode-Extension
npm run build-agents      # rebuilds agents.json from .md files
npm run build-bundles     # rebuilds bundle.json from ruleset+lorebook+agents
npm run validate-rulesets # confirms ruleset.json shape
npm run validate-bundles  # confirms bundle.json shape
```

Re-import `bundle.json` in Marinara to pick up changes (the framework's idempotency keys overwrite the previous install in place).

## Cross-OS install paths

- **Linux / macOS**: `cp -R rulesets/vtmv20 ~/Marinara/extensions/rulesets/`
- **PowerShell**: `Copy-Item -Recurse rulesets/vtmv20 $HOME/Marinara/extensions/rulesets/`
- **Node**: `node -e "require('fs').cpSync('rulesets/vtmv20', require('os').homedir()+'/Marinara/extensions/rulesets/vtmv20', {recursive: true})"`

(For most users the bundle.json paste-import is enough; the cp commands are only needed if you're hand-editing Marinara's local extension store.)

## Companion install — GM-Mode

If you also want to run V:TM V20 in Marinara's GM-mode chats (with the engine's combat / d20-tag / 50-char-reputation rails), install the companion bundle from **Marinara-RPG-Extension** repo at `rulesets/vtmv20/bundle.json`. Namespace is `mrr-vtmv20`. The two bundles can coexist — they install into different Marinara namespaces and produce different agent display names (`MRR:` vs `MRRP:`).
