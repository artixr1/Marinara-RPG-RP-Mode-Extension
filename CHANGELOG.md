Pending the next published release.

### Added — Step 1 of character-library storage evolution: chat-independent sheet keys (2026-05-06)

- **Sheet data decoupled from `chatId`.** New `characterKey(characterId)` returns `mrrp-character-{characterId}` — the post-v0.2.1 home for sheet data. `loadSheet` tries this key first, falls back to the legacy `mrrp-sheet-{chatId}-{characterId}` once with auto-migration (copies forward, leaves legacy in place for safety), then blank. `saveSheet` writes only to the character-library key. The `chatId` argument is retained for interface stability but unused in the new path.
- **`loadCharacters` migrates legacy bare `id: "player"` ids to fresh UUIDs on first load.** Every chat used to default to `id: "player"`, which would collide across chats under the new chat-independent key. Migration: each legacy "player" character gets a fresh `char-{Date.now()}-{random}` id, the chat's character list and `mrrp-active-char-{chatId}` pointer update, and the legacy chat-scoped sheet copies forward to `characterKey(newId)`. Each historical chat keeps its own distinct sheet — no data loss, no collision.
- **What this unlocks:** characters become portable across chats. Foundation for any future "import character into this chat" UI; foundation for Steps 2 (IndexedDB) and 3 (Marinara API mirror) per the roadmap at `~/cc-wiki/Roadmap/marinara-character-library-storage-evolution.md`.


## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-06

Sheet-ergonomics, item lifecycle, and multi-system damage release. Twenty-two iterative rounds of fixes against live in-Marinara playtest, all in service of getting D&D 5e and Exalted 3e to feel correct under the new two-tier inventory + state-mutator + bar UX models. The big themes:

- **Inventory is robust end-to-end.** Items survive load (no silent merge drop), agent-added items carry the full dialog field set (slot, damage, attack_attr, attack_proficient, use_effect, consumable, notes, category), the agent's own promptTemplate documents the schema as extension-confirmed, and consumable Use posts a tag the agent reads.
- **Bars finally make sense.** Every bar shows editable current AND max as separate inputs; user-set max overrides ruleset formula/literal so manual adjustments stick; refresh re-syncs both inputs to state after every state-mutator delta (no more stale UI confusing the agent on the next refresh).
- **Damage parser is multi-system.** `parseDamageExpression` handles D&D `NdM[+K] [type]`, Exalted `12L`/`12B`/`12A`/`12dL`/`12 Lethal` (rolls Nd10 → counts 7+ as successes per Exalted 3e), and flat `5 fire`. Weapons, items, and spells all share one parser.
- **Per-ruleset polish.** Exalted header now reads `Type` / `Caste/Aspect`; D&D Feats section enabled with `textOnly` rows; D&D 5e attribute modifiers + skill bonuses + saves are first-class autocalc; conditions tracker with roll-mode aggregation; item categories (equipment vs item) with separate Equipment section + Items flyout panel.



### Added — Sheet ergonomics batch (six features)

- **Editable numeric inputs everywhere.** Attributes, skills, derived stats, backgrounds, custom skills, and bar current values (HP, motes) all swap their value `<span>` for an `<input type="number">`. Type a number and press Enter or tab away to commit; the +/- stepper still nudges. Native browser spinners are suppressed because the stepper already provides that affordance and double controls are visual noise.
- **Identity row in the sheet header.** Two free-text fields below the character switcher whose labels are ruleset-driven: Race + Class (D&D 5e), Ancestry + Class (PF2e), Exalt Type + Caste (Exalted 3e), Concept + Trouble (Fate Core). New optional `header.raceLabel` / `header.classLabel` in the ruleset schema; old bundles fall back to "Race" / "Class".
- **D&D 5e Feats section.** The dnd5e ruleset and bundle now ship with `backgrounds: { enabled: true, label: "Feats", min: 0, max: 5, default: 0 }` and `"backgrounds"` inserted into `sheetSections` between states and inventory. The existing free-text dot-rated trait pattern carries D&D feats with no new section type.
- **Add custom skills / lores.** A "+ Add Skill" button at the foot of the Skills section pushes a fresh entry into `state.sheet.customSkills`. Each row has a free-text name input, optional linked-attribute select drawn from the ruleset's attributes, value display + stepper, and remove × button. Multiple custom skills are supported. Custom skill values participate in `statContext()` so dice formulas and `valueFormula` can reference them by name.
- **Autocalc for derived stats.** New optional `derivedStats[].valueFormula` (parallel to existing `maxFormula`). When present, the sheet displays the computed value and suppresses the manual stepper — the formula IS the override. Same `{StatName}` placeholder + arithmetic-only whitelist as `maxFormula`. Exalted 3e populated for Defense (Parry), Defense (Evasion), Resolve, Guile, Soak (Bashing), and Soak (Lethal).
- **Backwards-compatible storage shape.** New fields (`identity`, `customSkills`) default to empty on `blankSheet`; `mergeSheet` accepts either presence or absence. Old saved sheets load without migration.

### Fixed — v0.2.x Round 22 — Damage parser handles Exalted notation (NL/NB/NA, NdL/NdB/NdA, "N Lethal") (2026-05-06)

- **Damage parser was hardcoded to D&D's `NdM[+K] [type]` regex.** Live test in Exalted surfaced three Exalted-flavored damage strings the agent emitted that the parser rejected: `12L` (12 dice, lethal), `12dL` (dice-pool variant), and `12 Lethal` (word type). All three logged `rollWeaponDamage: cannot parse '...'` and the dmg button silently failed.
- **New unified `parseDamageExpression(s)`** returns a tagged result `{kind: "dnd"|"exalted"|"flat", ...}`. Three regexes feed it: D&D `NdM[+K] [type]`, Exalted single-letter `N[d]X` where `X ∈ {B,L,A}`, and flat `N type-word`. When the type word is Bashing/Lethal/Aggravated the flat branch routes to Exalted (matches Exalted convention that the number is dice pool count, not result). Anything else stays flat.
- **New `rollParsedDamage(parsed, opts)`** dispatches by kind: D&D rolls Nd-size and sums; Exalted rolls Nd10 and counts 7+ as successes (Exalted 3e damage convention — 10s do NOT double on damage rolls); flat posts the value as-is. Returns `{text, faces, kind}` so the caller finalizes via `finalizeRoll`.
- **`rollWeaponDamage`, `useItem`, and `castSpell` (ability.damageDice)** all now route through the unified parser. One contract, one place to extend when a future ruleset wants its own damage notation. Exalted `12L` weapons now roll 12d10 and count successes; `2d4+2 healing` potions still sum dice; `5 fire` flat values just post.
- **`mrrp-dice__face--success` CSS class** already existed; Exalted dice rolls now apply it to faces showing 7+ for visual success-counting feedback.
- **Re-paste the extension JS** to activate. No bundle change required.

### Fixed — v0.2.x Round 21 — Bars always show editable max + refresh syncs inputs + Willpower per-character cap (2026-05-06)

- **All bars now render an editable max input alongside current.** Previously `renderBar` gated the max input behind `!hasExplicitMax`, so Personal Motes / Peripheral Motes / Willpower (all formula- or literal-capped) hid the max — the player could only see "current" with no way to inspect or override the cap, and a state-mutator refresh attempt produced math errors because the agent had only one number to read. Now every bar shows `[current] / [max]` as two editable inputs. For ruleset-capped bars the max input default-displays the formula/literal value; typing a value persists to `state.sheet.derivedMax[name]` and overrides the ruleset (Anima boosts, temporary Willpower modifiers, GM-side tweaks the formula doesn't model). Tooltip on the max input names the formula/default explicitly so it's clear what the user is overriding.
- **`refresh()` now re-syncs both inputs to current state.** A state-mutator delta like `[mrrp-state: field="Personal Motes" delta="+5"]` writes to `state.sheet.derived["Personal Motes"]` and fires `refreshAllBars()`. Pre-fix: the bar fill + label updated, but the editable inputs kept showing stale numbers — the player saw "8" in the input but the bar said "13 / 25", and the GM agent's next refresh attempt computed against the stale display. Fix: refresh() unconditionally writes `inputEl.value` and `maxEl.value` from current state.
- **`computeMax()` derivedMax check moved to top.** User-set override now wins over `maxFormula`/`max` literal so manual edits stick across re-renders. Previously the formula always recomputed and clobbered the user override; now once the user types a max value, that's the cap until they clear it.
- **Willpower no longer has a hardcoded `max: 10` in the ruleset.** Canonical Exalted Willpower caps are per-character (typically 5–10 for Solars). The literal cap forced every character to display "10" as the cap. Removed `max: 10` from the exalted3e Willpower derived-stat definition; the user now sets the cap via the bar's max input. Default for fresh sheets falls through the auto-grow fallback until the user types a value (recommended: 5 for starting Solars).
- **Re-install the exalted3e bundle** to pick up the Willpower ruleset change. Re-paste the `extension/RPG-Extension-RP-Mode.js` to pick up the renderBar + refresh fixes (CSS already embedded by `tools/embed-css.mjs`).

### Added — v0.2.x Round 20 — Exalted header labels + capped-value display (2026-05-06)

- **Exalted 3e header labels updated.** `header.raceLabel: "Exalt Type"` → `"Type"`; `header.classLabel: "Caste"` → `"Caste/Aspect"`. Bundle regenerated; reflects the canonical Solar/Sidereal/Abyssal vocabulary (Exalts have a Type and a Caste; Dragon-Bloods use Aspect — the slash makes it work for both without forcing a single term).
- **Derived stats with declared caps now show "current / max" inline.** `renderValue` (used for `renderAs: "value"` derived stats) gained a `computeValueMax()` helper and an inline `mrrp-row__cap` span that reads `" / N"` whenever the ruleset declared a `max` literal or a `maxFormula`. Essence reads "5 / 10", any value-rendered capped stat reads similarly. The cap label refreshes when bars refresh, so a capped stat keyed on another stat's value (Personal Motes' max keyed on Essence) updates live. Editable input + stepper now also clamp to the computed cap when one is declared. CSS class `.mrrp-row__cap` styled in monospace dim-text matching the existing bonus suffix idiom.
- **`renderAs: "bar"` unchanged** — Willpower (already a bar with `max: 10`) keeps its bar-fill UX with the existing "current / max" label inside the fill. The new cap suffix only adds visibility to value-rendered stats that were previously bare numbers.

### Added — v0.2.x Round 19 — State-mutator agent body documents the full inventory schema (2026-05-06)

- **Agents themselves now know the full schema.** Round 18 wired the parser + helper + lorebook field-reference doc, but the agent's own `promptTemplate` (built from `agents/state-mutator.md` + per-ruleset overrides) still listed only the original 5 fields (`target/field/add/remove/qty/reason`) as canonical, so the agent kept saying "extended fields unconfirmed by parser" and refused to emit them. Updated all six source markdown files (shared `agents/state-mutator.md` + `rulesets/dnd5e/agents/state-mutator.md` + `rulesets/exalted3e/agents/state-mutator.md` per repo) with: (a) the inventory tag protocol line now lists the optional attrs inline; (b) a new `# Inventory schema (full field list — extension-confirmed)` section documents all 8 attrs with examples and the "repeated add enriches blank fields" semantic; (c) two new worked examples (stored consumable, weapon gift between characters) join the existing damage / save / spell-slot examples. The phrase "extension-confirmed" is deliberate — earlier rounds the agent's own diagnostic noted "no parser guarantee" on extended fields; the heading wording lets the agent know these ARE supported.
- **Rebuilt agents.json + bundle.json for all three rulesets per repo.** `tools/build-agents.mjs --all` regenerated `rulesets/{dnd5e,exalted3e,fate-core}/agents.json` from the updated source markdown; `tools/build-bundle.mjs --all` regenerated bundles. (pf2e is bundle-only; agents.json doesn't apply.) All gates green: `node --check`, `validate-rulesets` 3/3 PASS, `validate-bundles` 4/4 PASS.
- **Re-install is required to push the new schema to live agents.** Per the v0.4 architecture, agents are decoupled from the bundle and installed via the "Import Agents" dialog. To activate Round 19 in your live Marinara session: reload the extension JS, then re-import the regenerated `rulesets/dnd5e/agents.json` via the extension's Import Agents flow. The dialog uses delete-then-replace, so the State Mutator overlay's promptTemplate is replaced wholesale with the new schema-aware text.

### Added — v0.2.x Round 18 — State-mutator inventory tags accept full dialog field set (2026-05-06)

- **`[mrrp-state: action="add" field="inventory"]` now accepts dialog attrs.** The Round 17 fix made agent-added items survive load and render correctly, but the agent could only set `name`/`quantity`/`reason` — every other dialog field defaulted to empty. Logs from the live test showed the RP agent itself flagging the gap: "for stat/effect field support on inventory tags. Client parser behavior is unknown." The parser already extracted every `key="value"` pair via `STATE_KV_RE`; only `applyStateMutation` was throwing the rest away. New `applyItemAttrs(item, attrs)` helper maps `slot`, `damage`, `attack_attr` → `attackAttribute`, `attack_proficient` (bool), `use_effect` → `useEffect`, `consumable` (bool), `notes`, and `category` (`"equipment"` or `"item"`) onto the item. Snake-case keys are LLM-friendly inside a tag.
- **Auto-categorize new items by slot presence.** When the agent sends `slot="weapon"` without `category`, the new push order now applies attrs FIRST and normalizes SECOND, so the normalizer's existing slot-presence rule (`slot ? "equipment" : "item"`) infers `category="equipment"` automatically. Explicit `category="..."` always wins over inference.
- **Repeated adds enrich blank fields.** When `[mrrp-state: add="Sword" damage="1d8"]` hits a name-match in inventory, `applyItemAttrs` runs on the existing item before the quantity bump — agent can populate fields once authoritatively on first add, omit them on subsequent qty bumps. Empty strings are ignored (omit a field to leave it alone). Booleans only land on truthy values; once `true`, can't be unset via tag — use the dialog.
- **Field-reference lorebook entry advertises the full schema.** `buildFieldReferenceContent` now emits four worked examples (bare / stored consumable / weapon / armor) plus an 8-row attrs reference table. Auto-sync PATCHes the lorebook entry on next save, so the narrator and overlay agents see the new schema on the next generation without any manual lorebook edit.

### Fixed — v0.2.x Round 17 — Items vanish after edit, agent-added items render bare (2026-05-06)

- **State-mutator inventory.add now produces fully-formed items.** When the RP agent emits `[mrrp-state: action="add" field="inventory" add="Potion"]`, `applyStateMutation` was pushing `{name, quantity, description, location}` only — no `id`, no `category`, no dialog fields. Two downstream effects: (a) the item rendered bare in the Equipment / Items flyout (no slot, damage, bonuses) because the renderer reads fields that didn't exist, and (b) `mergeSheet`'s inventory branch silently dropped every id-less item on the next character switch / page reload. Net: items appeared "with the right name but no stats" and "got deleted any time another item was modified". Fix: state-mutator's add path now routes through a new `normalizeInventoryItem()` helper that fills `id`, `category`, `slot`, `damage`, `attackAttribute`, `attackProficient`, `bonuses`, `useEffect`, `consumable`, and `notes` to safe defaults.
- **mergeSheet self-heals legacy partial items instead of dropping them.** The inventory filter no longer requires `typeof it.id === "string"`. Instead, every loaded item runs through `normalizeInventoryItem(it, idx)`, which assigns a deterministic `item-heal-{nameSlug}-{idx}` id (stable across reloads so `state.sheet.equipped[slot]` references survive) plus all dialog-field defaults. Items already saved to localStorage from any prior session — including the broken pre-fix state-mutator pushes — are upgraded in place on next load, no manual re-add required.
- **State-mutator existing-name merge backfills missing fields.** When `[mrrp-state: action="add"]` hits a name-match in the inventory, the existing item now passes through `normalizeInventoryItem` before the quantity bump. Previously, an existing partial item stayed partial and would throw on `draft.bonuses.forEach(...)` when the user opened it for editing.

### Fixed + Added — v0.2.2 round (2026-05-06)

- **HP / bar manual entry now accepts any value.** Bug: when a derived stat is `renderAs: "bar"` with no `max` or `maxFormula` declared (D&D Hit Points), the input was clamping to `DEFAULT_BAR_MAX = 10`. Fix: when neither cap is declared the input is unclamped on the upper side, the stepper goes up to 9999, and the bar fill auto-grows so it always shows partial progress instead of saturating against a phantom 10.
- **Autocalc now actually computes D&D / PF2e skill bonuses.** Prior batch only handled derived-stat `valueFormula`; skills displayed raw user-entered numbers. New: when a ruleset declares `resolution.skillBonusFormula` (e.g. D&D's `"{linkedAttribute_mod} + {tierBonus}"`), every skill row shows the computed bonus and hides the raw stepper. Concrete behavior: Sleight of Hand at Dex 16, Trained, Level 4 displays **+5** automatically.
- **Attribute modifiers are now a first-class concept.** New optional `attributes[].modifierFormula` field — D&D 5e ships with `({Score} - 10) / 2`. The renderer computes each attribute's modifier on every refresh and exposes it under both `<name>_mod` and `<abbreviation>_mod` (so formulas can write `Dexterity_mod` or `DEX_mod` interchangeably).
- **Level + autocalc'd Proficiency Bonus.** D&D 5e gains a Level derived stat (default 1, max 20). Proficiency Bonus gets `valueFormula: "2 + (({Level} - 1) / 4)"` — automatically advances 2/3/4/5/6 at L1/5/9/13/17. Math.floor (not round) is now used for autocalc display so D&D mod (9-10)/2 = -1 (not 0) and Exalted ceiling formulas remain correct.
- **HP stays manual.** Explicitly: Hit Points has no `valueFormula` — the table decides their own HP method (max-per-level, rolled, average, etc.).
- **Saving Throws section.** New ruleset field `saves: [{ name, linkedAttribute }]` plus a `"saves"` sheetSection key. D&D 5e ships with all six (one per ability), each with proficiency-tier toggle. The displayed save bonus = attribute mod + tier bonus, computed live the same way skills are.
- **Item damage field.** Inventory items gain an optional free-text `damage` field ("1d8 slashing", "2d6 fire"); the item dialog has a Damage row between Slot and Bonuses; the inventory list shows the damage in a warning-hued cell next to the slot tag.
- **System-agnostic guarantee.** Every autocalc path is opt-in per ruleset: Exalted (no `modifierFormula`, no `skillBonusFormula`) keeps using `valueFormula`-on-derived only; D&D layers modifierFormula + skillBonusFormula on top; a future GURPS bundle can declare its own formulas without engine changes. The renderer respects whatever the ruleset provides.

### Fixed (carried forward from prior round)

- Pathfinder 2e bundle gained `attributes[].modifierFormula = "{Score}"` (PF2e attributes are already-modified) plus `Level` derived stat and `resolution.skillBonusFormula = "{linkedAttribute_mod} + {tierBonus}"`. PF2e tier formulas already include `{Level}`.

### Fixed — Agent visibility (LLM couldn't see the sheet)

- **First diagnosis (incomplete):** `syncSheetToChat` was button-triggered only and exported only legacy fields. Fix part 1 added auto-sync on save and a complete payload via new `buildSyncFields(prefix)` (identity, raw attributes, computed attribute mods, skill/save bonuses, custom skills, derived, states, backgrounds).
- **Live test surfaced the deeper bug:** Even with the auto-sync running and 45 fields PATCHed to `chats.customTrackerFields`, the overlay agents still saw zero numbers. **Reading the Marinara engine source revealed why:** `chats.customTrackerFields` only reaches generation context via Marinara's stock `custom-tracker` agent (which writes a snapshot to `gameStateSnapshots.playerStats.customTrackerFields` that the marker-expander then reads). The player's chat does not have the stock `custom-tracker` agent enabled — only the six `mrrp-overlay-v1` agents. So everything we PATCHed into the chat field was visible only to the chat UI tracker panel, not the LLM.
- **Real fix: prompt-template injection into managed agents.** New `buildSheetForPrompt()` renders the live sheet as a markdown block ("LIVE CHARACTER SHEET — Corey (Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition v1.0.0)…" with identity / attributes-with-mods / skills-with-computed-bonuses / saves / derived / inventory-with-damage / backgrounds). New `syncSheetToAgents()` GETs all agents, filters to managed overlays for the active ruleset, and PATCHes each agent's `promptTemplate` to embed the sheet block between `<!-- MRRP_SHEET_BEGIN -->` / `<!-- MRRP_SHEET_END -->` markers. New `injectSheetIntoPromptTemplate(prompt, block)` strips any prior block before prepending the new one, so updates over time never accumulate stale sheets.
- **Wired to the same debounce.** `scheduleAutoSync()` now fires both `syncSheetToChat` (for the UI tracker panel) AND `syncSheetToAgents` (the LLM-reaching path) on a single 1.5s debounce after every save and on ruleset activation. Six agents × one PATCH each per save burst = manageable round-trip cost on localhost.
- **No re-install required.** Reloading the JS extension is enough — the new sync path PATCHes the existing already-installed agents. Bundles do not need to be re-pasted to fix this.
- **Regression patched (round-5 hot-fix):** `syncSheetToAgents`'s filter was copy-pasted from the GM repo unchanged and looked for `s.mrrManaged === true && s.mrrRulesetId === rulesetId`. RP-mode agents are tagged with `mrrpManaged` / `mrrpRulesetId` per the namespace separation. Console log was the smoking gun: `[mrr] syncSheetToAgents: no managed agents for ruleset dnd5e` fired on every save — meaning the filter rejected all six existing agents, and the PATCH never ran. Filter now uses the correct `mrrp*` keys.

### Added — Player rolls (saves, initiative, attack, damage)

- **`quickRollForSave(save)`** — opens the dice widget pre-filled with mod = linked attribute modifier and prof = active proficiency tier bonus. Each save row now ends with a `roll` button.
- **`quickRollForDerived(derived)`** — opens the dice widget for any derived stat that declares `rollFormula`. D&D 5e Initiative ships with `rollFormula: "{Dexterity_mod}"`. Roll button on both autocalc and manual derived rows when rollFormula is set.
- **`quickRollAttack(item)`** — opens the dice widget pre-filled with 1d20 + attack-attribute modifier + (proficiency bonus when `item.attackProficient`) + equipped item bonuses. Item rows render an `atk` button when `item.attackAttribute` is set.
- **`rollWeaponDamage(item)`** — parses the damage string ("1d8 slashing", "2d6 fire", "1d4+1 piercing"), rolls, adds `attackAttribute_mod` if set, posts `[damage: …]`. Item rows render a `dmg` button when `damage` is set.
- **Item dialog** gains Atk attr dropdown + Proficient checkbox.
- **Schema:** `derivedStats[].rollFormula`; inventory items gain optional `attackAttribute` and `attackProficient`.
- **Skill-roll autocalc fix:** `quickRollForSkill` was filling `mod` from the raw `state.sheet.skills[name]` (always 0 with autocalc). Now reads `<linkedAttribute>_mod` when `skillBonusFormula` is set so dice widget pre-fills correctly.

### Fixed — State-mutator HP and other shorthand fields

- **Bug:** Console log `[mrr] state-mutator: unmatched field 'hp' — stashed on sheet root` fired every turn. The LLM emits `[mrrp-state: field="hp" delta="-X"]` but D&D's canonical derived-stat name is "Hit Points". `resolveSheetField` only matched canonical and case/punctuation-insensitive variants, so "hp" → normalized "hp" never matched "Hit Points" → "hitpoints". Mutation values stashed on the sheet root and the HP bar never moved.
- **Fix:** Added an aliases pass to `resolveSheetField`. Each derived stat / attribute / skill can now declare `aliases: [...]`. Attribute `abbreviation` is auto-recognized so `field="DEX"` resolves to "Dexterity" without needing an explicit alias. D&D 5e ships with: Hit Points → ["hp", "HP", "hitPoints", "hitpoints"], Armor Class → ["ac", "AC", "armorClass"], Initiative → ["init"], Proficiency Bonus → ["prof", "proficiency", "PB"], Speed → ["speed", "movement"], Level → ["level", "lvl", "characterLevel"].
- **Agent self-documentation:** `buildSheetForPrompt` now appends a "State-mutator field reference" block listing every canonical name with its declared aliases. The agent sees this in its prompt every turn and learns which names resolve.

### Added — Triple-coverage field reference (lorebook bridge)

The aliases pass and the agent-prompt block both reach our six overlay agents — but **the main narrator** (the model that actually emits `[mrrp-state: ...]` tags inside the chat narration) does not read overlay agent prompts. It reads the lorebook. So the field reference now lives in three places, and the narrator picks it up via the third:

- **`buildFieldReferenceContent()`** — formats the canonical names + aliases for every `derivedStats` / `attributes` / `skills` entry on the active ruleset, plus a "common compound mutations" cheat sheet (HP delta, condition add/remove, inventory gain).
- **`syncFieldReferenceToLorebook()`** — finds the managed lorebook for the active ruleset, finds (or creates) an entry tagged `mrrp-field-reference`, and PATCHes its content. The entry uses `constant: true` (Marinara's "always include" lorebook flag) so the narrator sees it every turn regardless of keyword triggers. Tagged so we update in place rather than spawn duplicates on every save.
- **Wired to the same debounce.** `scheduleAutoSync()` now fires three sync paths after every save and on activation: chat customTrackerFields (UI tracker panel) → overlay agent promptTemplates (six PATCHes) → managed lorebook field-reference entry (one PATCH).
- **Exalted 3e alias adoption:** Personal Motes / Peripheral Motes / Willpower / Essence / Health Track / Defense (Parry) / Defense (Evasion) / Resolve / Guile / Soak (Bashing) / Soak (Lethal) / Sorcerous Motes — each now declares the LLM's natural shorthands ("motes", "wp", "soakBashing", etc.). Same belt-and-suspenders that D&D got, system-agnostic — any future ruleset (GURPS, Lancer, Cyberpunk RED, …) just declares its own aliases and the triple-coverage applies automatically.

### Fixed — Bar max persistence and dotted-path stash

- **Bug:** Take 15 damage on D&D HP 15 → bar showed "0 / 10" (max collapsed). Cause: `computeMax` used `Math.max(DEFAULT_BAR_MAX, current)` when no engine cap was declared, so dropping current to 0 collapsed the visual max back to 10. The bar's denominator wasn't persistent.
- **Fix:** New `state.sheet.derivedMax` bucket — the user's typed max for bars without a ruleset-declared cap. `computeMax` prefers it over the auto-grow fallback, so the bar's denominator survives any current-value change. `renderBar` now renders a SECOND editable input next to current when no engine cap is declared (D&D HP); a "/" separator sits between them. Engine-capped bars (Exalted Motes/Willpower) hide the max input — engine still controls them via maxFormula.
- **`mergeSheet`** validates `derivedMax` on load; old saves without it default to `{}`.
- **Bonus fix: dotted-path support.** The state-mutator was emitting `field="deathSaves.failures"` and the resolver flattened it onto the sheet root as a single key. Now the stash fallback splits on `.`, walks/creates nested objects, and writes the leaf — so `deathSaves.failures = +1` lands at `sheet.deathSaves.failures` correctly. Sets the floor for future structured-state features (D&D death saves, exhaustion levels, custom trackers) without locking the schema.

### Added — Advantage / disadvantage on d20 rolls

- **Three-way toggle** in the dice widget (single-roll mode only): Normal (1d20), Adv (2d20 keep highest), Dis (2d20 keep lowest). Active mode picks up the accent color. Persists in `state.diceAdvantage` across rolls within a session.
- **Result text shows both faces.** Format: `[dice: 2d20kh1+5+2 vs DC15 = 19 success (kept 19, dropped 7 — advantage)]`. The state-mutator and any GM reading the chat see exactly what landed and what didn't.
- **Wired into existing roll buttons.** `quickRollForSkill`, `quickRollForSave`, `quickRollForDerived`, `quickRollAttack` all open the dice widget — the player picks adv/dis once and rolls.

### Added — Spell cast workflow (DC + damage + lorebook)

- **`Cast` button on every spellbook ability with cast-time data** (damageDice, saveAttribute, or spellcastingAttribute). One click computes the spell save DC, rolls damage, and posts both as chat tags ready for "Send to chat".
- **Auto-computed DC.** Formula is ruleset-driven via `resolution.spellSaveDcFormula`. D&D 5e ships with `"8 + {Proficiency Bonus} + {spellcastingAttribute_mod}"`. PF2e bundle ships with `"10 + {Level} + {spellcastingAttribute_mod}"`. The `{spellcastingAttribute_mod}` token is pre-substituted with the spell's specific caster-attribute mod before evaluation.
- **Cast tag format:** `[mrrp-cast: name="Fireball" dc="15" save="Dexterity" damage="8d6 fire" half_on_save="true" cost="1 lvl-3 slot"]`. Followed by the rolled `[damage: 8d6 = 27 fire (Fireball)]`. The narrator reads both — DC for save resolution, damage to apply post-save.
- **Spell fields** added to the ability dialog: Damage (free-text dice), Cast attr (caster's spellcasting ability), Save vs (defender's save target), Half on save (D&D 5e half-damage default). All optional — non-spell abilities (passives, social charms) leave them blank and the Cast button doesn't render.
- **Lorebook entry** now embeds a "Cast Mechanics" block with all four cast fields. The GM/state-mutator agents read it when the spell's keyword fires in chat — they see exactly which save to call for, the DC, and the half-on-save rule, without having to re-derive from narration.
- **Workflow:** create spell in spellbook → it auto-syncs to the lorebook → click Cast → DC + damage tags drop into the dice widget → "Send to chat" → narrator/GM agent resolves saves and applies damage via the existing `[mrrp-state: field="hp" delta=...]` pipeline.

### Added — Active conditions on the sheet (with mechanical effects)

- **New "Conditions" section** on the character sheet between States and Backgrounds. Lists currently active conditions from `state.sheet.conditions` with × remove buttons; add via a dropdown of ruleset-declared options or a free-text "other" entry.
- **Ruleset-declared condition definitions.** New `ruleset.conditions: [{ name, description, imposesDisadvantageOn?, grantsAdvantageOn? }]` schema field. Each condition can declare which roll categories — `attack`, `save`, `skill` — it imposes disadvantage or grants advantage on.
- **Mechanical effects on rolls.** New `conditionRollMode(category)` helper aggregates every active condition's effect. `quickRollForSkill`, `quickRollForSave`, `quickRollAttack` consult it before opening the dice widget — auto-arming the Adv/Dis toggle. Disadvantage wins ties.
- **Agent visibility.** `buildSheetForPrompt` emits an "Active Conditions" block with each condition's effects + description, so the narrator sees "Poisoned — disadvantage on attack, skill" without the player having to narrate it.
- **D&D 5e bundle adoption.** All 15 SRD conditions ship: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Grappled, Incapacitated, Invisible, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone, Restrained, Stunned, Unconscious, Exhausted. Roll-mode mappings encoded for the canonical SRD effects.
- **State-mutator pipeline unchanged.** The existing `[mrrp-state: field="conditions" add="..."]` tags still drive `state.sheet.conditions`; the new layer just visualizes and consults the data.

### Fixed — Two D&D leaks in the core engine (system-agnostic discipline)

- **`castSpell` DC fallback removed.** Now ruleset-driven only — when `spellSaveDcFormula` isn't declared, the cast tag posts without a DC.
- **`quickRollAttack` proficiency lookup generalized.** Was `ctx["Proficiency Bonus"]` (hardcoded stat name); now reads `resolution.attackProficiencyFormula` (D&D 5e bundle declares `"{Proficiency Bonus}"`).
- Zero hardcoded D&D conventions remain in runtime paths. The core extension provides generic engine surface; per-system rules live entirely in the bundle.

### Added — Text-only background entries (D&D Feats)

- **New `backgrounds.textOnly: bool`** schema flag. When true, name-only rows (no dot value, no stepper). D&D 5e Feats use it; Exalted/WoD systems leave it false to keep the dot rating.

### Added — Two-tier inventory: Equipment + Items flyout

- **Item shape:** new optional `category` (`"equipment"` | `"item"`), `useEffect` (dice expression), `consumable` (bool). `mergeSheet` infers category from slot presence on legacy items.
- **Equipment section** filters inventory to category="equipment", renamed visually from "Inventory" to "Equipment".
- **Items flyout** — separate floating panel (mirrors spellbook). "Open items" button at foot of Equipment. Lists items with quantity, useEffect, Use / Edit / Delete buttons.
- **`useItem(item)`** parses useEffect via DAMAGE_RE, rolls, posts `[mrrp-use: name="..." effect="..." rolled="..." consumable="true"]`. Decrements quantity; removes when 0.
- **Item dialog** gains Category / Use effect / Consumable rows.
- **System-agnostic:** Exalted's burner phone (item, no slot) and artifact bracers (equipment, slot=arms) work identically.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-06

The first substantive Roleplay Mode release after the v0.0.1 initial publish. Brings the framework to functional parity with the GM Mode sibling at v0.4.0, with additions specifically suited to roleplay-mode (the narrator runs alongside Marinara's default world-state, prose-guardian, continuity, and expression agents instead of replacing the engine's own GM). Ships a self-contained download under `releases/v0.2.0/` with seven AI-feedable build docs, two complete reference rulesets (D&D 5e and Exalted 3e), and drop-in install files. Targeted at users who want to point a chat AI at the documentation and have it author a complete ruleset for any tabletop RPG system.

### Added — Typed damage on tracks

- **`damageTypes` schema field** on `renderAs: "track"` derived stats. Declares a list of damage types (id, label, severity, description). When present, the renderer shows each filled cell colored by type, stacks higher-severity damage to the leftmost positions, and provides per-type "Take" buttons plus a "heal worst" button.
- **State-mutator routes typed damage automatically.** `field="bashing" delta="+3"` mutates `state.sheet.track["Health Track"].bashing`. Mirror-mapped against the active ruleset's declared damage type ids.
- **CSS modifier classes** `.mrrp-track__cell--<typeId>` for each declared type. Bashing yellow, Lethal red, Aggravated dark maroon in the bundled Exalted ruleset; system authors define their own palette.
- **Migration:** legacy single-counter `track[name] = N` data folds into `bashing` (the lightest type) on first read so existing characters auto-upgrade without data loss.

### Added — Sorcery / multi-turn casting

- **`sorcery` ability category** is special-cased by the spellbook → lorebook push. Entries get a `Type: Sorcery` content header and a `sorcery` keyword, signaling the state-mutator to use multi-turn shape-sorcery flow instead of immediate-cost charm flow.
- **`Sorcerous Motes` derived stat + `Sorcery Circle` / `Shaping Spell` states** added to the Exalted reference ruleset; documented as the system-agnostic pattern for any RPG with multi-turn casting.
- **State-mutator override walks the casting workflow:** declare → roll → accumulate → unleash with Willpower refund, plus leak-on-no-action and abort-on-switch handling. Documented in `releases/v0.2.0/docs-for-ai/05-AGENT-AUTHORING.md`.

### Added — Build pipeline separation

- **`tools/build-agents.mjs`** — generates `rulesets/<system>/agents.json` from per-system overrides + shared baseline `agents/*.md`. The `main` role comes from `gm-agent.md`; sub-agent roles fall back to the shared baseline when no per-system override exists.
- **Per-system agent override pattern.** Drop a `.md` at `rulesets/<system>/agents/<role>.md` to tune any role for that system; the build tool prefers the override over the shared baseline. System-agnostic by default, system-specific by exception.
- **Bundle no longer carries agents.** `tools/build-bundle.mjs` produces `bundle.json` with ruleset + lorebook only. Agents install through Marinara's Import Agents dialog as a separate operation. Decoupling lets prompt updates ship without forcing users to reinstall the entire ruleset.

### Added — Documentation for AI-assisted authoring

- **`releases/v0.2.0/docs-for-ai/`** — seven numbered Markdown files designed to be fed to a chat AI (ChatGPT / Claude.ai / Gemini) so the AI can author a complete ruleset for any system. Covers overview, agent architecture, schema, lorebook format, agent prompt-writing patterns, build pipeline, and copy-paste prompts for AI authoring.
- **`releases/v0.2.0/examples/`** — two complete worked examples (D&D 5e and Exalted 3e) that AI authors can pattern-match against.
- **`releases/v0.2.0/install-files/`** — the framework JS plus pre-built `bundle.json` and `agents.json` for both example systems. Three pastes from zero to playing.
- **`releases/v0.2.0/BUILD-YOUR-OWN-RULESET.md`** — three options for non-technical users (AI-with-repo, AI-with-zip, manual).

### Fixed — Critical correctness bugs

- **CSP-safe formula evaluator** — the framework's `{StatName}*N+M` parser uses a hand-rolled recursive-descent evaluator instead of `new Function`. Marinara's page CSP blocks `'unsafe-eval'` in many configurations; every formula was throwing silently and bar maxes were falling back to `DEFAULT_BAR_MAX = 10`. The Personal Motes bar on an Essence-7 Exalt was showing /10 instead of /31. Now correctly evaluates with parens, unary +/-, integer and decimal literals.
- **State-mutator field-name normalization** — `peripheralMotes` resolves to schema's `Peripheral Motes`, `hp` to `HP`, etc. Lowercase + strip whitespace/underscore/hyphen on both sides of the comparison. Eliminates the failure mode where AI-emitted variants got stashed as ghost root keys.
- **Max-clamp on numeric deltas** — `field="Personal Motes" delta="+999"` caps at the formula-computed maximum instead of overflowing. Refresh-to-full works correctly. Resolver consults `derived.maxFormula` (evaluated against live stat context) or static `derived.max`.
- **Persisted state-mutator dedupe** — `processedMessageIds` now persists per-chat in `localStorage["mrrp-processed-msgs-<chatId>"]`. Hard refresh no longer replays every historic mutation. Initial DOM sweep on load only re-wraps tag spans for hidden display; mutations that have already applied don't fire again.
- **Lorebook install rewritten** — the bulk endpoint was returning OK but landing zero entries. Replaced with per-entry POST loop matching the proven spellbook write path. Re-install now does delete-then-add to wipe stale entries instead of accumulating duplicates. `tag: "..."` (singular string) replaced with `tags: [...]` (plural array) on each entry to match Marinara's API expectation.
- **Floating panel position clamp on load** — saved positions outside the current viewport now clamp into bounds on restore instead of leaving the sheet stranded offscreen. The drag handler already clamped at move time; the load path now matches.
- **`saveSheet()` no-args call fixed** — `finalizeMutation` was calling `saveSheet()` with zero args, hitting the early-return guard and never persisting. Now correctly passes `(state.chatId, state.sheet)`.
- **`applyStateMutation` numeric path looked at `sheet.bars` (doesn't exist)** instead of `sheet.derived` / `sheet.attributes` / `sheet.skills`. Every numeric delta was writing ghost top-level keys. New `resolveSheetField()` walks the typed maps; legacy fallback path warns instead of silently corrupting state.

### Fixed — UX

- **Health track grouping.** Adding `-0` / `-1` / `-2` health levels via the Ox-Body buttons no longer appends them after Incapacitated. Penalty-descending stable sort groups like-with-like.
- **Agent prompt FORBIDDEN section** in the Exalted state-mutator override calls out the field-name traps the model used to invent. Pairs with a new `state-reminder` per-system override that surfaces canonical field names every turn.
- **Bundle gmAgent prompt openings refreshed** to remove "Marinara Engine's Game Mode" and "the main GM model" framing. Now opens with cooperative framing: "You provide rules guidance for ⟨system⟩ in Marinara Engine's roleplay mode, working alongside the engine's default world-state, prose-guardian, continuity, and expression agents."
- **`gm-agent.md` source files** had the engine reputation-50-char workaround paragraph removed — that constraint applies only to Game Mode, not the roleplay mode this overlay targets.

### Schema

- `ruleset.json` derivedStats with `renderAs: "track"` may declare an optional `damageTypes: [{id, label, severity, description}]` array.
- `ruleset.json` `abilities.categories` may include `{ "id": "sorcery", "label": "Sorceries" }` to enable the multi-turn casting flow on lorebook push.
- Bundle schema unchanged top-level (still `mrrp-bundle` v1).
- Agent collection schema is `mrrp-agents` v1 — new in v0.2.

### Engineering

- Chat-message `MutationObserver` no longer watches `characterData` mutations.
- Chat-message debounce swapped from raw `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` to `marinara.setTimeout` + monotonic-token cancel pattern.

### Removed

- The bundle's `additionalAgents[]` field is no longer authored by humans. Existing bundles with `additionalAgents` still install correctly under v0.0.1 framework JS; with v0.2 framework JS the install path skips the bundle's agents and expects the user to import agents separately.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-30

Initial roleplay-mode publish. Forked the GM-mode framework, swapped the
`mrr-` prefix for `mrrp-` so both extensions can coexist on the same Marinara
install, recast the GM-Agent prompts as cooperative narrator agents that run
alongside Marinara's default narration agents instead of replacing them.
Initial bundles for D&D 5e and Exalted 3e.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-01

Initial scaffold. Forked from `Marinara-RPG-Extension` v0.3.0 to target
Marinara Engine's **Roleplay Mode** (`chatMode: "roleplay"`) instead of
Game Mode (`chatMode: "game"`).

### Added
- Bundle envelope discriminator: schema string is now `mrrp-bundle`. The
  installer matches on this string and rejects bundles authored for any
  other Marinara overlay.
- `mrrp-` namespace across the framework — localStorage keys, agent
  type, agent settings flags, lorebook tags, CSS classes, embed style
  id, console debug surface, and bundle prompt prefix all now use
  `mrrp-` so this overlay can coexist on the same Marinara instance as
  the Game-Mode extension without collision.
- Two reference rulesets ported from the Game-Mode extension: D&D 5e
  (SRD 5.1) and Exalted 3rd Edition.

### Architectural changes from Game-Mode extension
- Targets Marinara's roleplay mode. Roleplay mode default agents are
  `world-state`, `prose-guardian`, `continuity`, `expression` — none of
  Game Mode's `game-master`, `combat`, `party-player`, or `quest`.
- No engine-imposed combat encounter modal, no d20-tag prompt format,
  no 50-character reputation `action` cap. The overlay owns all dice
  math and rules adjudication via the in-extension dice widget.
- Custom agents (`type: "mrrp-overlay-v1"`) dispatch in roleplay mode
  the same as in game mode — verified by reading
  `agent-pipeline.ts` / `agent-executor.ts` directly. Engine does not
  filter custom-typed agents by `chatMode`.

### Known limitations / next steps for v0.1
- Agent prompts in `rulesets/*/gm-agent.md` were ported with engine
  framing intact; they refer to "Game Mode" in places and include the
  reputation 50-char-cap workaround. These will be refreshed in a
  follow-up to drop game-mode-specific guidance and frame as roleplay
  cooperative-context-injection alongside the engine's default
  roleplay agents (world-state, prose-guardian, continuity).
- No browser-tested install yet against a running Marinara at
  `localhost:7860`. Public push deferred until that test passes.
- v0.0.1 ships a single overlay agent per ruleset. Multi-agent
  ambitions (state-tracker agent, lore-lookup agent) deferred to v0.1+.
